# Resume
A simple portfolio made with HTML,CSS & Javascript.

#Portfolio Website (Link)
Managing the portfolio site was always a pain if just frontend was used. Even for minute changes to be made, whole website code was to be formatted. I have used django for CMS (Content Management Service) to ease the pain of editing whole code for any changes.

I am basically working on making this project an opensource Portfolio Management System and will soon be releasing a multi functional and generic PMS (Portfolio Management System).

Any contributions from you guys are welcome. Just fork this repository, make changes in the code and create a pull request, I will merge the changes if it seems interesting. :)

Do star the repo if you think it worth it.
